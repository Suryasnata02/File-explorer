# CapStone Projct-1

1. Project Overview
The Linux Console File Explorer is a command-line utility developed in C++ that provides a menu-driven interface for common file and directory operations within a Unix-like file system environment (such as Linux or WSL). It serves as a practical demonstration of using low-level C and system libraries (<dirent.h>, <sys/stat.h>, <unistd.h>) within a C++ application wrapper for file system management.
